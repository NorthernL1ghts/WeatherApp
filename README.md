## Weather App:
- This is a very simple website application that uses a live API to get the 'weather' information. This information includes - "humidity, wind-speed, and temperature" of a location.
## Warning:
- In order for this to work on your device, you may need to get your own api key, if you don't current have one. 

## How to get a 'API key':
- This is quite simple to do - you just go to (https://api.openweathermap.org/) once logged in you can get a 'API key'and replace it in index.js file on line 9.

```javascript
const APIKey = 'Your Api Key';
```
